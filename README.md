oasp4js Extensions
==========

oasp4js extensions are [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) modules which address typical issues, such as authentication and authorization, internationalization, etc. which are not addressed by AngularJS out of the box. These solutions are built on top of industry proven practices.

oaps4js extensions are available as bower components; consequently you can make use of them in your application (even without going for the application template).
