What is oasp4js?
==========

oasp4js stands for Open Application Standard Platform for JavaScript. oasp4js gives you a platform combining best-in-class frameworks, libraries, tools and our add-ons to start up a JavaScript project very quickly. Currently, the focus of oasp4js is put on JavaScript applications which run in the web browser (the growing trend towards using JavaScript also on the server side did not go unnoticed however).

What does oasp4js offer?
==========

oasp4js enables you to start up a One Page Application from a project template. What you get is:

* a  [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) script supporting typical development routines such as adding HTML documents, writing JavaScript code and testing it, building the target application (where JavaScript files are obfuscated and minimized), etc.
* an application skeleton built on top of
    * best-in-class frameworks and libraries such as [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    * oasp4j extensions (e.g. in the form of [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) modules) implementing industry proven solutions to common problems (e.g. I18N, Authentication and Authorization, etc.)

To see how it all works, you can run a [sample application](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-sample).

In addition to the project template you can take advantage of many tutorials, guides and code conventions.

I know neither JavaScript nor AngularJS. How can I get started?
==========

Not a problem. AngularJS is worth learning JavaScript :) We would recommend you to take our [crash JavaScript course](http://oasp.github.io/oasp4js/tutorials/js4ng-beginners.html). After that you can read either the [AngularJS tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial) or our training materials.
